Throughout my work on the SNHU Travel project I learned the importance of interpreting user needs and translating them into actionable program features. The process required user stories because they provided essential information about user needs which enabled me to divide requirements into smaller tasks. The user stories allowed me to establish work priorities while confirming that product features matched user needs and product development created actual benefits. The approach showed me that Agile methods which include iterative development and feedback loops together with continuous testing enable programs to adapt better to evolving requirements.

My program development methods have been influenced by Agile principles which I intend to use during all my upcoming work. The Scrum practices which I learned through Sprint Planning Daily Scrums and Retrospectives helped me develop skills for maintaining organization and effective communication while managing project modifications. A team member must engage in active participation by providing progress reports and seeking clarification through questions while helping the team achieve shared objectives. The experiences demonstrated to me that software development requires collaboration between team members who must maintain clear communication while following structured processes and addressing user requirements to produce high-quality outcomes.
